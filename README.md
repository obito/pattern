# pattern

Filter different colors in an image, originally to facilitate sewing patterns

# Original Problem

The original problem was for some friends, who were sewing, and who had a lot of trouble following patterns because it's very confusing, with a lot of patterns on one page. Some even gave up sewing because of that.

# Solution

So the idea came to me to make a software/website that would allow to filter the different colors on a pattern, and thus facilitate the vision.
