# pattern

Filter different colors in an image, originally to facilitate sewing patterns.

# Original Problem

The original problem was for some friends, who were sewing, and who had a lot of trouble following patterns because it's very confusing, with a lot of patterns on one page. Some even gave up sewing because of that.

# Solution

So the idea came to me to make a software/website that would allow to filter the different colors on a pattern, and thus facilitate the vision.

# Example

The example is really bad, because because because of the shadow, the detection is not done correctly. I will change this example later. Here is a (very bad) example:
